Mailfind - Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition
Goal
The goal of the MVP is to deliver a single, high-value AI feature directly within the user's existing workflow with minimal friction. This will validate the core concept of an AI-enhanced email experience.

Core Feature: AI-Powered Summarization in Gmail
The MVP will consist of a Chrome Extension that performs one primary function:

Authentication: The user can securely connect a single Google Account via OAuth2.

UI Injection: When an email thread is open in Gmail, the extension will add a "Summarize with Mailfind" button near the subject line.

AI Summarization: When the button is clicked, the extension will:
a.  Securely send the content of the email thread to the backend.
b.  The backend will use an LLM (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate a concise, bullet-point summary.

Display: The extension will display the generated summary in a clean, unobtrusive overlay or sidebar within the Gmail interface.

Out of Scope for MVP
To maintain focus, the following features are explicitly not part of the MVP:

Semantic Search

Automatic Categorization

Support for multiple accounts

Outlook or other email provider integration

A standalone desktop application

This focused scope will allow for rapid development, testing, and a quick feedback loop.
